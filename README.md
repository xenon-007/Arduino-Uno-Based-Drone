# ESP32-Drone

Drones have rapidly evolved from niche hobbies to versatile tools with a wide range of applications, from photography to agriculture or even for defense and military purposes. Depending on the application, features and payload capacity their price will vary from pocket changes to a few million. Even though the basic principle behind these drones may appear simple, there is a lot of technology and computation that goes behind it for proper operations and a desired result from these drones. For example, maintaining stability while in the air requires precision sensors such as a Gyroscope and proper processing of reading taken with it. In this project we are going to make such a drone which can be easily controlled using our phones.
This DIY drone is small in size and can be built using easily available components such as ESP32 modules, MPU6050 IMU, coreless motors and plastic propellers.
